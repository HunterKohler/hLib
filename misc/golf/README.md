# Language Differences

Language differences are sectioned by site/challenge etc.

## [Code.golf](http://code.golf)

On [Code.golf](http://code.golf), there are a few allowances they make for
languages. Those that I know of will be put herein. Any problem may have
slightly different rules, especially in relation to input.

### C

May ommit include statements for some modules. Example: do not need to
`#include <stdio.h>` to use `printf()`. Not sure the extent of this, but it
seems to be consistent with the extension GCC provides, which they also use.

### Python

Unknown

### Javascript

`arguments` holds ARGV, `print()` to output with a newline, `write()` to output
without a newline.

Don't have to use keywords for variable declarations: `var`, `let`, `const`
