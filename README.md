# Projects

All ongoing project are described here. See the associated subfolders in
[projects](./projects) for more information.

## STL

A naive implementation of some assets of the C++ Standard Library. Currently,
implementations attempt to follow the C++20 standard. Motivation for the
project comes from a great attraction to the language and its complexity;
moreover that, in implementing some parts of the STL, I may better understand
the language, its fundamentals, standards, and the community.

## Wargames

Collection of efforts to learn more about software security, networking,
and related fields. Includes work related to the participation in
[wargames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)),
and the study of
[pen-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test).
Interest in wargames eventually drove an interest into more areas of
cyptography and the associated mathematics (see the
[cryptography](#Cryptography) project).

## Cryptography

Research in descrete mathematics related to cryptography. Furthermore, the
project includes implementations of some important cryptographic algorithms
and data structures. These are intended to be fully functional implementations
based on thorough work and collegiate study.

# Papers

The [papers](./papers) directory includes a number of formalized assignments
and stand alone papers. Most focused on particular interests in math or
computer science. Find the finalized papers here:
